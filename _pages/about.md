**Short Bio:** My name is <i>Lương Minh Nhật</i> - Vietnamese. I am currently a first-year Student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://university.fpt.edu.vn/ky-thuat-phan-mem/">Software Engineering</a>, <a href="https://university.fpt.edu.vn/campus/?index=4">FPT University HCMC Campus</a>, Vietnam. I am passionate about full-stack development, with a keen interest in both front-end and back-end technologies. I am actively seeking to expand my experience through various projects.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
